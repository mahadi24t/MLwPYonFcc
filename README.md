Machine Learning With Python — FreeCodeCamp Journey
Welcome! 👋
This repository is a living portfolio of my learning journey through the Machine Learning with Python Certification by freeCodeCamp.

Here, you’ll find annotated Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb), source code, and personal notes covering my progress through hands-on labs, coding exercises, and capstone projects. My goal is to both document my studies and create a knowledge base for fellow learners and future collaborations.
