# Hi hope you're well .. Currently I am learning "Machine Learning with python" from Freecodecamp platform. I want to add progress on github with each code like ipynb files or practice coding. I want You to write me a beautiful read.me So that it can add value of it. Here is the course information and topics covered.. perdon me for messy situation as this is I just copied from website. "Machine Learning with Python

Machine learning has many practical applications that you can use in your projects or on the job.
In the Machine Learning with Python Certification, you'll use the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning.
You'll also dive into neural networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.
Courses
TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open source framework that makes machine learning and neural networking easier to use.
The following video course was created by Tim Ruscica, also known as ‚ÄúTech With Tim‚Äù. It will help you to understand TensorFlow and some of its powerful capabilities.

How Neural Networks Work
Neural networks are at the core of what we call artificial intelligence today. But historically they've been hard to understand. Especially for beginners in the machine learning field.
Even if you are completely new to neural networks, these video courses by Brandon Rohrer will get you comfortable with the concepts and the math behind them.
