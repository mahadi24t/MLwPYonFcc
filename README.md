# Machine Learning With Python — FreeCodeCamp Journey

Welcome! 👋
This repository is a living portfolio of my learning journey through the [Machine Learning with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/) by freeCodeCamp.

Here, you’ll find annotated Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), source code, and personal notes covering my progress through hands-on labs, coding exercises, and capstone projects. My goal is to both document my studies and create a knowledge base for fellow learners and future collaborations.

## 🚀 About the Certification

Machine learning enables smarter applications and powerful data-driven solutions. In this course, I’m learning how to:

- Build, train, and evaluate neural networks with **TensorFlow**
- Master machine learning fundamentals (e.g., supervised/unsupervised algorithms, classification \& clustering)
- Explore advanced techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) with RNNs and deep reinforcement learning
- Complete practical real-world machine learning projects
